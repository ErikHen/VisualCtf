# Visual CTF

Source code for https://visualctf.app, a simple tool for visualizing your Contentful content types.

This tool was initially just meant for internal use, when I needed to get an overview of a large Contentful model. I wanted to get an overview with minimal ammount of effort, and I wanted to try out .Net Blazor. 

Feel free to suggest changes by opening an issue. Or even better, make a pull request.
